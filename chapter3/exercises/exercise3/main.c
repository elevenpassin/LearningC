        Exercise 3:

        For each of the following pairs of scanf format strings, indicate
   whether or not the two strings are equivalent. If they're not, show how they
   can be distinguished.

        a) "%d"				vs " %d"
        b) "%d-%d-%d" vs "%d -%d -%d"
        c) "%f"				vs "%f "
        d) "%f,%f"    vs "%f, %f"
